# Cryptography
Cryptography is the science of using secret codes. A **Cryptographer** is someone who uses and
studies secret codes.
But the secret codes deosn't always remains secret, A **Cryptanalyst** is someone who can
hack secret codes and read other people’s encrypted messages. Cryptanalysts are also called **CODE BREAKERS** or **HACKERS**.

## CODES vs CIPHERS
The development of the electric telegraph in the early 19 th century allowed for near-instant communication through wires across continents. This was much faster than sending a horseback rider carrying a bag of letters. However, the telegraph couldn’t directly send written letters drawn on paper. Instead it could send electric pulses. A short pulse is called a “dot” and a long pulse is called a “dash”.
In order to convert these dots and dashes to English letters of the alphabet, an encoding system (or code ) is needed to translate from English to electric pulse code (called
encoding ) and at the other end translate electric pulses to English (called decoding ).
The code to do this over telegraphs (and later, radio) was called Morse Code, and was
developed by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail. By tapping out dots and dashes with a one-
button telegraph, a telegraph operator could communicate an English message to someone
on the other side of the world almost instantly!
Codes are made to be understandable and publicly available. Anyone should be able to look
up what a code’s symbols mean to decode an encoded message.

### ROT13 Cipher
ROT13 ("rotate by 13 places", sometimes hyphenated ROT-13) is a simple letter substitution cipher that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it, in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the Caesar cipher, developed in ancient Rome.
